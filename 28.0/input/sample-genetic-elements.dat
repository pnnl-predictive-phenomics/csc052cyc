;;==========================================================================
;; Sample genetic-elements.dat file.
;; 
;; This file contains a set of records, one for each genetic element
;; (chromosome, plasmid, etc.) or contig in the organism. Each genetic
;; element is described by a single annotation file.
;; Records are terminated by a
;; single line containing only the string "//". (The "//" is also
;; required after the final genetic element.) Each record contains a
;; set of attribute-value pairs, one per line, separated by the tab
;; character. Lines beginning with ; are comment lines. Valid
;; attributes are:
;;
;; ID
;;   Required. Identifier for the genetic element. The identifer must
;;   be unique with respect to all other identifiers used in the PGDB,
;;   such as gene and protein identifiers. The ID should start with an
;;   alphabetic character, and contain no spaces or special
;;   characters. Numbers are allowed, as are dashes and underscores.
;;   Case insensitive.
;;
;; NAME
;;   Required. Descriptive name for the genetic element.
;;
;; TYPE
;;   Optional. One of :CHRSM, :PLASMID, :CONTIG, :MT (mitochondrial
;;   chromosome), or :PT (chloroplast chromosome). Defaults to :CHRSM.
;;
;; CIRCULAR?
;;   Required (except for contigs). Is the genetic element circular?
;;   One of Y or N.
;;
;; CODON-TABLE
;;   Optional; defaults to the codon table specified in the
;;   organism.dat file, or to the standard codon-table if not
;;   supplied. This should be a number between 1 and 15.
;;
;; ANNOT-FILE
;;   Required. Filename for the annotation file for this
;;   genetic element. The file must be in one of the following file formats:
;;   - PathoLogic format (file suffix .pf)
;;   - GenBank format    (file suffix .gb or .gbk or .gbff)
;;   - GFF3 format       (file suffix .gff3 or .gff)
;;   If a GenBank file is supplied, the
;;   SEQ-FILE attribute (see below) should be omitted, and the
;;   sequence of the genetic element will be extracted from this
;;   file. If the file is in the <ORG>cyc/<VERSION>/input/ directory,
;;   then only the filename is required, otherwise a full pathname
;;   must be supplied.
;;
;; SEQ-FILE
;;   Optional. Filename for the sequence file for this genetic
;;   element. The file must be in FASTA format (file suffix .fna,
;;   .fsa, .fa, .fasta, or .seq). If the ANNOT-FILE attribute
;;   specifies a file in GenBank format, the SEQ-FILE attribute may be
;;   omitted, and the genetic element sequence will be extracted from
;;   the GenBank file. If the file is in the <ORG>cyc/<VERSION>/input/
;;   directory, then only the filename is required, otherwise a full
;;   pathname must be supplied.
